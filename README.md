😏 What's next for Inclusive Insights
The scalability of Inclusive Insights is very high. We wanted to implement a deep fake-based text-to-speech so that it can imitate the voice of the selected wise woman and read the generated texts. The other feature is to implement more features to the threejs museum.

More people, more inclusivity, and more scenes!
Longer and more nuanced interactions with the help of ChatGPT
Company integration, maybe? 😛
